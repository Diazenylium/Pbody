        <p>P-Body is accustomed to working with a partner, Atlas. He is also a robot made by Aperture Science and is also equipped with a version of the Aperture Science portal gun that P-Body has. Both P-Body and Atlas are programmed for research purposes, but they can perform rudimentary manual labor with their humanoid limbs.

        <p>P-Body has extensive experience with the portal gun she is equipped with, capable of using its spacetime-puncturing properties to solve puzzles. It has yet to be determined how the portal gun will come into play in future employment, although it could potentially be used for quick transportation around a construction site or some such situation.
